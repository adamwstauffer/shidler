# Specs

Store your technical specifications and working drafts here.

## Typical Contents

- `spec-draft-v1.md` — Initial specification draft
- `spec-final.md` — Polished specification for submission
- `named-ranges.md` — Reference list of all named ranges and their definitions

## What Makes a Good Spec

A strong specification should:
- Be **reproducible** — another analyst can build the model from the spec alone
- Use **named-range pseudocode** (e.g., `INC_net / startYear_equity`) instead of cell references
- Cover all **inputs, assumptions, calculations, and outputs**
- Be **internally consistent** — variable names match across all sections
- Be **concise** — 2–3 pages maximum
