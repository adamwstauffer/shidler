# Stage 5 – Final Analysis & Recommendation (6 Points)

**Due:** TBD

## Goal

Deliver a polished, executive-ready memo summarizing your accounting ratio analysis and providing strategic recommendations. This combines quantitative rigor, interpretation, communication, and forward-looking perspective — exactly what senior finance leaders expect from analysts.

**Hint:** Think of this as another step in your workflow — have your LLM generate a draft based on your Stage 3/4 spreadsheet output, then refine it with your own analysis and judgment. If you don't have AI access, write it directly from your spreadsheet results.

## Deliverable Requirements (1–2 page `.md` file uploaded to GitHub)

Must include:

---

### A. Company & Data Summary

Brief restatement:
- Company name, industry, and fiscal year analyzed
- Data sources used (10-K, Yahoo Finance, etc.)
- Any key assumptions (tax rate, cost of capital)

---

### B. Ratio Results Summary

Present your key findings organized by category:

| Category | Key Ratios to Highlight | What to Discuss |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Performance** | MVA, Market-to-Book, EVA | Is the company creating or destroying value? |
| **Profitability** | ROA, ROC, ROE | How effectively does the company generate returns? |
| **Efficiency** | Asset Turnover, Inventory Days, Collection Period | How well does the company manage its assets? |
| **Leverage** | Debt Ratio, Times Interest Earned, Debt Burden | How much financial risk is the company taking? |
| **Liquidity** | Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio | Can the company meet short-term obligations? |
| **Du Pont** | ROE decomposition | What drives returns — margin, turnover, or leverage? |

Focus on **insight rather than computation** — the CFO already has the numbers.

---

### C. Interpretation & Key Findings

For each ratio category, provide:
- What the ratio values **mean** in context
- Whether the values suggest **strength** or **concern**
- How they **compare** to general benchmarks or industry norms (if available)

Highlight the most important 3–5 findings that would matter to a CFO.

---

### D. Du Pont Analysis Discussion

Decompose ROE into its components and explain:
- Is profitability (margin) the main driver?
- Is asset efficiency (turnover) strong or weak?
- Is leverage amplifying returns — and is that sustainable?

---

### E. Strategic Recommendations

Provide 2–4 actionable recommendations based on your analysis. Examples:
- "Improve inventory management to reduce Days in Inventory from X to Y"
- "Current leverage ratio of X suggests capacity for additional debt financing"
- "Low quick ratio of X warrants building a larger cash buffer"
- "Strong EVA of $X confirms value creation — consider communicating this to investors"

Support each recommendation with data from your model.

---

### F. Executive Justification

Use management-level reasoning:
- Financial health assessment
- Operational efficiency opportunities
- Capital structure observations
- Liquidity position
- Value creation track record
- Accounting and reporting implications
