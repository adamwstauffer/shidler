See the course schedule below.
Make-up exams may be given only under very rare circumstances, and the instructor reserves the
right to deduct points as deemed appropriate. If you must miss an exam, you need to request
approval from the instructor before the absence. No make-up exam will be given without prior
permission and will be considered only in legitimate, unavoidable circumstances (serious illness,
family emergency, etc.). Proper documentation for the absence must be presented. If allowed, make-
up exams will be scheduled at the instructor’s discretion. Make-up quizzes or exams may be more
rigorous and graded to a higher standard than the original. If You believe that there is an error in the
grading of an exam, you should call it to the instructor's attention within a week after the results are
posted on Laulima. If a student believes a question has been ungraded unfairly, the policy is to re-
grade the entire homework/exam.

Because UHM is an academic community with high professional standards, its teaching, research, and
service purposes are seriously disrupted and subverted by academic dishonesty. Such dishonesty
Prof. Adam Stauffer - Spring 2026 - BUS 314: International Business Finance
includes cheating and plagiarism, as defined below. Ignorance of these definitions will not provide an
excuse for acts of academic dishonesty.
IMPORTANT Definitions for Plagiarism and Cheating,
Cheating includes but is not limited to:
● giving or receiving unauthorized assistance during an examination;
● obtaining unauthorized information about an examination before it is given;
● submitting another's work as one's own;
● using prohibited sources of information during an examination;
● fabricating or falsifying data in experiments and other research;
● altering the record of any grade;
● altering answers after an examination has been submitted;
● falsifying any official University record; or
● misrepresenting facts to obtain exemptions from course requirements.
Plagiarism includes but is not limited to:
● submitting, in fulfillment of an academic requirement, any work that has been copied in whole
or in part from another individual's work without attributing that borrowed portion to the
individual;
● neglecting to identify as a quotation another's idea and particular phrasing that was not
assimilated into the student's language and style or paraphrasing a passage so that the reader
is misled as to the source;
● submitting the same written or oral or artistic material in more than one course without
obtaining authorization from the instructors involved; or
● "drylabbing," which includes obtaining and using experimental data and laboratory write-ups
from other class sections or previous terms.
