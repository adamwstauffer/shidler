## 🎯 Overview
Analyze a historical or ongoing **currency crisis** or **monetary shock** using a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude, Perplexity Pro, or DeepResearch. You will:
- Select a crisis/monetary event (examples below)
- Collaborate with an LLM to **refine your prompt** and craft a professional report
- Produce a **0.5-page executive summary** + **2-page main report** (excluding cover/addendum)
- Submit a single **PDF** to **Lamaku**

**Examples (non-exhaustive):**
- Currency crises: *Mexico 1994; Asia 1997; Russia 1998; Argentina 2001; Turkey 2018; Sri Lanka 2022*  
- Monetary shocks: *Crypto adoption in El Salvador/Argentina; de-dollarization attempts; USD dominance episodes*

## 🔁 Prompt Evolution Requirement
A key learning goal is **iterative prompt engineering**:
1. Start with a simple question (Initial Prompt).  
2. Ask the LLM to **improve** your prompt (role, scope, sections, references).  
3. Use the **Revised Prompt** to generate the report; iterate as needed.  
4. Log your interactions in a **Prompt Log** (retain privately; you’ll submit prompts verbatim in the Addendum).

### Example Revised Prompt
> You are a global macroeconomist. Write a 2-page graduate-level report on the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis with three sections: (1) Source/Causes, (2) Contagion mechanisms, and (3) Policy responses and resolutions. Include valid references and verify links. Prepend a ½-page executive summary. Output suitable for PDF export.

---

## 🧪 Suggested Structure (Main Report)
- **Background / Source of Crisis** — origins, triggers, context  
- **Contagion or Broader Impacts** — transmission across markets/countries  
- **Resolution & Recovery** — policy interventions, effectiveness, lessons  

> Use graduate-level writing; include inline citations where appropriate. Figures are optional unless required by your instructor.
