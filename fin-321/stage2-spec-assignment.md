## Stage 2 – Technical Specification (6 Points)

**Goal:** Using `fin-321/stage2-spec-template.md`, produce a **2–3 page quantitative specification** describing how you will build and analyze your firm’s FX hedge model.

### Scenario

You will continue from the same exposure introduced in your Stage 1 memo.
Your firm expects to receive a **foreign-currency payment (e.g., EUR, JPY, GBP)** on a defined future date.
Your task now is to translate that business exposure into a **technical plan** that a treasury analyst—or an AI assistant—could follow to construct a spreadsheet model and evaluate alternative hedging strategies.

---

### Include

1. **Problem Statement** – Summarize the exposure, timing, and risk in professional language.
2. **Inputs (Known Variables)** – List all variables, units, and data sources you will need.
3. **Assumptions & Constraints** – Clarify simplifications and conventions (e.g., interest-rate basis, transaction costs).
4. **Calculation Flow** – Lay out the logical sequence for computing hedge outcomes (forward, money market, options).
5. **Outputs** – Identify the specific results, charts, and metrics your model should produce.
6. **Sensitivity Plan** – Describe how you will test and visualize outcomes across exchange-rate scenarios.
7. **Limitations & Next Steps** – Note what is excluded and how this sets up your Stage 3 Excel build.

### Instructions

* **Use the template:** Start from `fin-321/stage2-spec-template.md`.
* **Keep formulas conceptual:** describe logic and sequence, not cell equations.
* **Maintain professional tone:** you are advising the CFO or Director of Treasury.
* **Think ahead:** design your spec so it can directly feed the spreadsheet, prompt, and final analysis stages.
* **Be concise:** clear, complete, and no filler—2 to 3 pages maximum.

---

### Deliverable

* File name: `stage2-spec-LASTNAME.md`
* Length: 2–3 pages
* Tone: Professional, quantitative, and business-ready
* **Due Date:** **November 7**
* **Points:** 6 (graded on clarity, structure, and analytical logic)
