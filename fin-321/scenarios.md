# 📘 Example Scenarios – EUR Receivables (USD Base, 1-Year Horizon)

### 📌 Quick Note on Setting the Spot FX Rate, Strike Price (K), and Interest Rates

When you see a placeholder like:
* **Put on EUR with (k =) [EURUSD]**
* **Call on EUR with (k =) [EURUSD]**
* **USD Interest Rate:** [n.nn%]
* **EUR Interest Rate:** [n.nn%]

…it means you are responsible for **determining the strike price (K) and interest rates** based on **current market data**.

Here’s how to approach it:

1. **Look up the current EURUSD spot rate** (e.g., from Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, or your preferred data source).
2. Use this **spot rate as the starting point** for your strike price (k). In most basic hedge setups, the strike is set **at or near the current spot**.
