# analysis/ – Data and Computational Work

This folder stores the analytical backbone of projects: spreadsheets, CSV datasets, Python notebooks, and scripts.

---

## 📊 Purpose

The **analysis phase** turns theory and prompts into empirical work. Students collect, clean, and analyze data to support arguments.

---

## 📂 Typical Contents

- `.csv` – Clean datasets or raw data  
- `.xlsx` – Spreadsheet models and calculations  
- `.ipynb` – Jupyter notebooks for Python analysis  
- `.py` / `.r` – Custom scripts for modeling and visualization  

---

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Load Data** – Import from IMF, World Bank, or historical series.  
2. **Clean & Prep** – Handle missing values, normalize, or compute growth rates.  
3. **Analyze** – Apply models (e.g., contagion, parity conditions, VAR).  
4. **Visualize** – Output charts for `figures/`.  
5. **Export** – Generate summary tables or CSVs for `deliverables/`.
