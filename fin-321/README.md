# INTL-FINANCE Course Directory

This folder contains all materials, specifications, and student work related to **FIN-321: International Finance** and related macro/microeconomic modules.

The structure follows the spec-driven workflow used across our economics curriculum:

1. **prompts/** â€“ Example LLM prompts and prompt-improvement exercises.
2. **specs/** â€“ Project specs and templates defining scope, methods, and outputs.
3. **analysis/** â€“ Datasets, spreadsheets, Jupyter notebooks, and scripts used in analysis.
4. **figures/** â€“ Graphs, charts, and visualizations generated during analysis.
5. **deliverables/** â€“ Final memos, briefs, reports, and peer-reviewed submissions.

This structure mirrors professional economic research pipelines and supports transparent, reproducible work.

## ðŸ“Š Learning Workflow

Each project in this course typically follows this sequence:

1. **Spec Phase** â€“ Define your problem, scope, and expected outputs (`specs/`).
2. **Prompt Phase** â€“ Draft and iteratively improve LLM prompts to generate insights (`prompts/`).
3. **Analysis Phase** â€“ Use quantitative tools, spreadsheets, and models to test theories (`analysis/`).
4. **Visualization Phase** â€“ Create figures to support arguments and conclusions (`figures/`).
5. **Deliverable Phase** â€“ Produce a final report or memo for review (`deliverables/`).
