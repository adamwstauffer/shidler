# Extra Credit (Up to 3 Points)

**Due:** TBD

## Overview

Earn up to **3 extra-credit points** by demonstrating how modern tools and workflows can enhance your accounting ratios project. Choose **at least two** of the following areas and write a brief discussion (200–400 words total) as an addendum to your Stage 4 deliverable, or as a separate `.md` file.

**AI tools are NOT required.** Students without access to AI tools can earn full extra credit through Options 4 and 5.

## Option 1: Claude Skills / ChatGPT Custom GPTs (1 point)

Discuss or demonstrate how a **Claude Skill** (Claude.ai project with custom instructions) or **ChatGPT Custom GPT** could automate or improve your ratio analysis workflow.

Examples of what a Skill/Custom GPT could do:
- Accept a company ticker and automatically structure the financial data for ratio computation
- Validate that all named ranges are correctly defined
- Generate a formatted ratio summary from raw financial statement inputs
- Compare your company's ratios against industry benchmarks
- Produce a draft executive memo from computed ratios

**To earn this point:** Describe what the Skill would do, what inputs it would take, and what outputs it would produce. If you build one, include the instructions/prompt and a sample output.

## Option 2: Claude Code / AI-Assisted Coding (1 point)

Discuss or demonstrate how **Claude Code** (CLI tool), **GitHub Copilot**, or another AI coding assistant could enhance your project.

Examples:
- Use Claude Code to read your spec file and generate an Excel workbook programmatically (e.g., via Python + openpyxl)
- Use Claude Code to validate your spreadsheet formulas against your spec
- Generate a Python script that computes all ratios from CSV financial data
- Automate data extraction from SEC EDGAR filings
- Create a comparison dashboard across multiple companies

**To earn this point:** Describe the workflow, show sample code or commands, and explain how it improves reproducibility or efficiency.

---

## Option 3: Claude Cowork / Multi-Agent Collaboration (1 point)

Discuss or demonstrate how **Claude Cowork** (multi-agent workflow in Claude Code) or a similar multi-step AI pipeline could be applied to financial analysis.

Examples:
- **Agent 1:** Extracts financial data from a 10-K filing
- **Agent 2:** Computes all ratios and checks internal consistency
- **Agent 3:** Generates an executive summary memo with recommendations
- **Pipeline:** Spec review -> Model generation -> Validation -> Report drafting

**To earn this point:** Describe the multi-agent workflow, what each agent does, and why breaking the work into agents improves quality or efficiency. If you run it, include the output.

## Option 4: GitHub & Version Control (1 point)

**No AI required.** Discuss how GitHub and version control apply to financial modeling and analysis.

### What to Cover:
- **Version Control Basics:** How commits, branches, and diffs create an audit trail for your model
- **Why It Matters in Finance:** Hedge accounting documentation, internal controls, data lineage, SOX compliance
- **Collaboration:** How branching and pull requests enable multi-analyst workflows
- **Your Project:** How you used GitHub across Stages 1–4 (commits, file organization, iterative improvements)

**To earn this point:** Demonstrate that your GitHub repo has meaningful commit history showing iterative progress (not just a single "upload all" commit).

---

## Option 5: Industry Comparison or Multi-Year Trend Analysis (1 point)

**No AI required.** Extend your analysis beyond a single company and single year.

### Options:
- **Industry Comparison:** Compute the same ratios for a direct competitor and compare side-by-side. Discuss what the differences reveal about business strategy.
- **Trend Analysis:** Compute ratios for 2–3 years and discuss trends. Is profitability improving? Is leverage increasing? Is liquidity tightening?

**To earn this point:** Include the additional data and analysis in your spreadsheet and discuss findings in your Stage 4 memo or a separate addendum.

---

## Submission

- Include your extra credit work as a clearly labeled section in your Stage 4 deliverable, or as a separate file (e.g., `extra-credit-LASTNAME.md`).
- Clearly state which options you are addressing.
- If you used AI tools, include the AI & LLM Usage attribution section.
