# BUS-314 Multi-Stage Project – Accounting & Performance Ratios

Author: Adam Stauffer
Last Updated: 2026-02-24

## Project Overview

In this four-stage project you will select a **publicly traded company**, pull data from its most recent financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Cash Flow Statement), and build a comprehensive **accounting ratios model** in Excel. Along the way you will write a professional memo, construct a working spreadsheet, draft a technical specification documenting your model, and deliver a final analysis with strategic recommendations and a structured AI prompt.

Each stage builds on the last — your memo frames the problem, your Excel build implements the model, your spec documents and reflects on what you built, and your final analysis interprets the results for management.

## Deliverable Timeline

| Stage | Deliverable | Points | Due Date |
|-------|------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Executive Memo | 4 | TBD |
| 2 | Excel Model Build | 6 | TBD |
| 3 | Technical Specification | 4 | TBD |
| 4 | Final Analysis, Prompt Engineering & Recommendation | 10 | TBD |
| EC | Extra Credit | up to 3 | TBD |
| | **Total** | **24 + 3 EC** | |

## Ratio Categories Covered

Your model will compute ratios across six categories taught in class:

1. **Performance** – MVA, Market-to-Book, EVA
2. **Profitability** – ROA, ROC, ROE (start-of-year and average-based)
3. **Efficiency** – Asset Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Inventory Turnover, Profit Margin
4. **Leverage** – Debt Ratios, Times Interest Earned, Cash Coverage, Debt Burden
5. **Liquidity** – Current Ratio, Quick Ratio, Cash Ratio, NWC-to-Assets
6. **Du Pont System** – ROA and ROE decomposition

```

## Getting Started

1. Read `company-selection.md` to pick your public company.
2. Work through the stages in order — each one feeds the next.
3. Use `template-memo.md` and `template-spec.md` as starting points.
4. Store your working files in the `archive/` subdirectories.
5. Upload final deliverables to GitHub.

## AI Tools (Optional, Not Required)

AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or Copilot can accelerate your work — especially in Stage 4. However, **AI is not required for any stage.** Students without AI access can complete every deliverable using standard resources (SEC filings, Excel, class notes). If you use AI, document it per the course AI Usage Guidelines.

## Key Resources

- **Financial Statements:** SEC EDGAR, Yahoo Finance, Macrotrends, company investor relations pages
- **Class Spreadsheet:** `BUS-314/_spreadsheets/BUS-314 Accounting & Performance Ratios - MASTER.xlsx`
- **Course AI Guidelines:** `docs/ai-usage-guidelines.md`
