# Stage 1 – Executive Memo (4 Points)

## Goal

Using `template-memo.md`, write a **300–400 word memo** to your company's CFO (or VP of Finance) explaining why a comprehensive **accounting ratio analysis** is valuable and what insights you expect to uncover.

---

## Scenario

You are a **Financial Analyst** at a publicly traded company of your choice (see `company-selection.md`). Your CFO has asked you to evaluate the company's recent financial health using standard accounting and performance ratios. Before building the model, you need to write a brief executive memo framing the project.

## Instructions

### Include

1. **Company Overview** – Name the company, its industry, and a one-sentence description of its business.
2. **Why Ratio Analysis Matters** – Explain what ratio analysis reveals about financial performance, efficiency, leverage, and liquidity that raw financial statements alone do not.
3. **Six Ratio Categories** – Briefly introduce the six categories you will analyze (Performance, Profitability, Efficiency, Leverage, Liquidity, Du Pont) with a one-line description of each.
4. **Data Sources** – Identify where you will pull the financial statements (e.g., SEC EDGAR 10-K, Yahoo Finance, company investor relations page).
5. **Next Steps** – Preview what you will build in Stages 2–4:
   - **Stage 2:** A working Excel model computing all ratios from real financial data.
   - **Stage 3:** A technical specification documenting your model's structure, formulas, and lessons learned.
   - **Stage 4:** A final analysis memo with strategic interpretation, recommendations, and a structured AI prompt.

### Format

- **Deliverable:** One page (PDF or Markdown), file name `stage1-memo-LASTNAME.md`
- **Tone:** Executive-friendly and clear — no jargon-heavy explanations.
- **Due Date:** TBD

## How This Sets Up Later Stages

| Stage | What This Memo Enables |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Stage 2** | Your company choice, data sources, and ratio categories feed directly into the Excel model. |
| **Stage 3** | Your framing gives context to the technical specification you'll write after building the model. |
| **Stage 4** | Your "why it matters" reasoning returns as the executive justification and helps structure the AI prompt. |

> *A strong memo shows you understand both the analytical purpose and the business value of ratio analysis — exactly what a CFO wants to see before investing analyst time.*
