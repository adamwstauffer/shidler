# Prompts

Store your AI prompts and iterations here. This directory tracks how your prompts evolve from initial drafts to final, production-ready versions.

## Typical Contents

- `prompt-v1.md` — Initial prompt attempt
- `prompt-v2.md` — Refined after first AI output
- `prompt-final.md` — Polished, submission-ready prompt
- `prompt-log.md` — Log of prompt iterations with notes on what changed and why

## Prompt Iteration Workflow

1. **Draft** — Write your initial prompt based on your Stage 2 spec.
2. **Test** — Run the prompt through your AI tool and review the output.
3. **Refine** — Identify gaps (missing data, wrong formatting, incorrect formulas) and update the prompt.
4. **Validate** — Compare AI-generated output against your Stage 3 model.
5. **Finalize** — Clean up the prompt for submission.

## Tips

- Keep each version as a separate file so you can show iteration.
- Note what changed between versions in your prompt log.
- The best prompts are specific, structured, and include all required data values.
