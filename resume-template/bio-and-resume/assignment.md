Perfect — here’s a **student assignment write-up** that combines both pieces: creating a **GitHub bio (main README)** and a **resume draft (RESUME.md)**. You can drop this into your LMS, email, or even as the assignment description in your syllabus.

# 📘 Assignment: GitHub Bio + Resume Draft

### 🎯 Objectives

* Learn how to use GitHub as a professional portfolio tool.
* Create a **personal bio** (in your repo’s main `README.md`).
* Create a **draft resume** (in `RESUME.md`) following professional standards.
* Export your resume to **PDF** for submission.

---

## Part 1: Create Your GitHub Bio (Main README)

1. Create a new GitHub repository named something like:

   * `yourname-portfolio`
   * `bio-and-resume`

2. The repo will initialize with a file named `README.md`.

   * This is the first thing visitors see when they visit your repo.
   * Think of it as your **online bio**.

3. In `README.md`, write a short **bio/introduction**:

   * Who you are (student, major, expected graduation year).
   * Your academic and professional interests.
   * Skills (languages, software, tools).
   * Optional: a fun fact, personal interest, or a short career goal statement.

## Part 2: Create Your Resume Draft (RESUME.md)

1. In the same repo, **add a new file** called `RESUME.md`.

   * **Leadership Experience**
   * **Honors & Awards**
   * **Skills & Interests**

Keep bullet points **short, action-oriented, and quantifiable**.
