# Stage 1 – Executive Memo (4 Points)

## **Goal:** Using 'fin-321/memo-template.md', write a 300-400 word memo to your CFO explaining your firm’s **FX receivable exposure** and why hedging is worth considering.

## **Instructions:**
**Scenario:** 
You will be presented with a scenario in which your firm expects to receive a foreign-currency payment (e.g., EUR, JPY, GBP) on a specific future date. Exchange rate volatility could affect how much your company ultimately receives.

**Include:**
1) What the exposure is (currency, amount, timing).  
2) Why it’s risky (what could go wrong for USD proceeds).  
3) Three hedge families with quick pros/cons for each hedging strategy.  
4) Next steps (what analysis you’ll build in Stages 2–5).
    - **Excel Model Build (Stage 2):** Build a working .xlsx prototype that computes and compares hedge outcomes for your scenario.
    - **Technical Specification (Stage 3):** Document what you built and design an improved version—precise enough for an AI to reconstruct.
    - **Prompt Engineering (Stage 4):** Write a prompt that instructs an AI to generate the full spreadsheet from your spec.
    - **Final Analysis & Recommendation (Stage 5):** Choose a hedge strategy using your model results and present the case to the CFO.

**Deliverable:** One page (PDF or Markdown).  
**Tone:** Executive-friendly and clear.  
**Due date:** October 24
