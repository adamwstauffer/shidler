# FIN-321 Multi-Stage Project – FX Exposure and Hedging Strategies

Author: Adam Stauffer
Last Updated: 2026-02-23

## Project Overview

This project guides students through the full analyst-to-automation workflow used in corporate treasury and financial risk management. Beginning with a business-level problem, students progressively translate FX exposure into a working model, a formal specification, an AI-generated deliverable, and a final executive recommendation.

## Deliverables

| Stage | Deliverable                       | Points | Due         |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | -----: | ----------- |
| 1     | Executive Memo                    |      4 | Oct 24      |
| 2     | Excel Model Build                 |      6 | Nov 7       |
| 3     | Technical Specification           |      4 | Nov 20      |
| 4     | Prompt Engineering                |      4 | Dec 12      |
| 5     | Final Analysis & Recommendation   |      6 | Dec 12      |
| **Total** |                               | **24** |             |

## Stage Sequence & Rationale

The project follows a **Build → Document → Automate** workflow:

1. **Stage 1 – Executive Memo:** Define the business problem and frame the hedging decision for the CFO.
2. **Stage 2 – Excel Model Build:** Build a working prototype from the scenario. Experiential knowledge of what the model requires in practice informs every subsequent stage.
3. **Stage 3 – Technical Specification:** Document what was built and articulate an improved design. A spec written after building is more precise, more realistic, and more useful as an AI prompt input.
4. **Stage 4 – Prompt Engineering:** Use the spec and model to write an AI prompt that generates a professional, reproducible spreadsheet.
5. **Stage 5 – Final Analysis & Recommendation:** Interpret model results and deliver an executive-ready hedge recommendation.
