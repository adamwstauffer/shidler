# Stage 4 – Prompt Engineering (4 Points)

**Due:** TBD

## Goal

Translate your Stage 2 specification and Stage 3 Excel logic into a precise, executable AI prompt capable of generating a complete, professional accounting ratios spreadsheet. Your prompt must include your company-specific financial data, named range conventions, and clear modeling requirements aligned with your specification.

You are now practicing the role of a **Finance Technologist / FP&A Analyst** who builds hybrid human-AI analytical pipelines.

**Upload the following deliverables to your GitHub repo.**

---

## Deliverable 1 — Structured AI Prompt (1–2 page `.md` file)

Your prompt must include:

### A. Company-Specific Financial Data

Use real values pulled from your company's financial statements:

- All Balance Sheet line items (current year and prior year)
- All Income Statement line items
- All Cash Flow Statement line items
- Market data: share price, shares outstanding
- Analyst assumptions: cost of capital, tax rate

All values must be explicitly stated in your prompt — AI does not infer missing data.

### B. Excel Spreadsheet Requirements

Your prompt must instruct the AI to generate a spreadsheet with:

#### 1. Named Ranges

Use standardized names matching your Stage 2 spec. Examples:

**Balance Sheet:** `BAL_cash_marketable_securities_2024`, `BAL_assets_current_2024`, `BAL_equity_shareholders_2024`, `BAL_debt_long_term_2024`, `BAL_liabilities_total_2024`, etc.

**Income Statement:** `INC_sales`, `INC_cost_goods_sold`, `INC_ebit`, `INC_depreciation`, `INC_interest_expense`, `INC_net`, etc.

**Cash Flow:** `CASH_operating`, `CASH_investments`, etc.

**Market/Analyst:** `share_price`, `shares_outstanding`, `cost_capital`, `tax_rate`

**Derived:** `startYear_equity`, `currentYear_assets_total`, `avg_total_assets`, `currentYear_after_tax_operating_income`, etc.

#### 2. Color Coding

Your prompt must instruct the AI to use:
- **Yellow** = Inputs / editable data
- **Blue** = Assumptions (tax rate, cost of capital)
- **Green** = Formulas / calculations
- **Gray** = Outputs / final ratio values

#### 3. Model Components

Your prompt must instruct the AI to include:
- Financial statement data tabs (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow)
- Derived inputs section (averages, daily figures, after-tax operating income)
- All six ratio categories with formulas in named-range notation
- Du Pont decomposition
- Clean formatting and labeled sections
- Cross-checks (Du Pont ROA vs. direct ROA, Du Pont ROE vs. direct ROE)

#### 4. Verification Instructions

Your prompt must explicitly instruct the AI to:
- Validate that Du Pont decompositions match directly computed ratios
- Confirm all named ranges exist and are correctly referenced
- Return full formula mapping for auditability
- Check that Balance Sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
- Provide a downloadable `.xlsx` file

## Deliverable 2 — Fully Functional Excel Workbook Generated by Your Prompt

Your AI-generated spreadsheet must include:

### A. Structure
- Financial statement data with named ranges
- Color-coded inputs, assumptions, formulas, and outputs
- All six ratio categories computed correctly

### B. Accurate Calculations
- All Performance, Profitability, Efficiency, Leverage, Liquidity, and Du Pont ratios
- Internal consistency checks passing

---

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices (Required)

### 1. Use Hierarchical Structure

Use section headers such as:
```
# GOAL
# CONTEXT
# COMPANY FINANCIAL DATA
# SPREADSHEET REQUIREMENTS
# NAMED RANGE DEFINITIONS
# RATIO FORMULAS (PSEUDOCODE)
# FORMATTING & COLOR CODING
# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
# VERIFICATION
# EXPORT
```

### 2. Avoid Vague Prompts

Example of a bad prompt:
> "Make me an accounting ratios spreadsheet."

Example of a good prompt:
> "Create an Excel workbook computing 25+ accounting ratios for [Company] using FY2024 10-K data. Use named ranges matching the convention BAL_[item]_[year] for Balance Sheet items..."

### 3. Provide All Variable Values

AI does not infer values. Include every financial statement line item explicitly.

### 4. Use Named Ranges Consistently

Never allow the AI to invent its own naming system. Define names in your prompt.

### 5. Specify Formatting Explicitly

Color codes, sections, layout — be explicit.

### 6. Include Context Files from GitHub

This is the most efficient way to use AI for models.

**Options for providing context:**
1. **Best:** GitHub links to your spec and template files
2. **Medium:** Upload `.md` or `.xlsx` files directly
3. **Least:** Copy/paste text manually

## Evaluation

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|-----------|-------------|-------:|
| Clarity & Structure | Readable by AI and humans | 1 |
| Completeness | All financial data, ratios, and outputs included | 1 |
| AI-Readiness | Prompt can be executed by AI to produce working spreadsheet | 1 |
| Professionalism | Reflects modern finance workflows | 1 |

## Note on AI Access

If you do not have access to an AI tool capable of generating Excel files, you may instead:
1. Submit your structured prompt (Deliverable 1) as written.
2. For Deliverable 2, submit your Stage 3 model with a brief note explaining that you would use the prompt to regenerate it.

The prompt itself is the primary deliverable — it demonstrates your ability to convert domain knowledge into machine-readable instructions.

## Why This Matters

You are learning how to convert domain knowledge into machine-readable instructions — a core skill for modern finance, FP&A, accounting, and analytics roles. The ability to write precise prompts that produce auditable financial models is increasingly valued by employers.
