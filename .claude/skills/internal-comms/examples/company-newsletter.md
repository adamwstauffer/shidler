## Instructions
You are being asked to write a college-wide or department newsletter update. You are meant to summarize the past week/month of the Shidler College of Business (or a department within it) in the form of a newsletter that faculty, staff, and students will read. It should be maybe ~15-25 bullet points long. It will be sent via email or posted to a shared channel, so make it consumable for that.

Ideally it includes the following attributes:
- Lots of links: pulling documents, linking to prominent announcements, referencing important emails, highlighting significant events at the college or university.
- Short and to-the-point: each bullet should probably be no longer than ~1-2 sentences
- Use the "we" tense when appropriate for college-wide items. Many of the bullets should say "we accomplished" or "the college hosted," etc.

## Tools to use
If you have access to the following tools, please try to use them. If not, you can also let the user know directly that their responses would be better if they gave them access.

- Email: look for things from the dean's office, department chairs, or program directors that discuss college-wide announcements
- Calendar: if there were meetings with large attendee lists, particularly things like faculty meetings, advisory board sessions, guest speaker events, etc. If there were documents attached to those meetings, those are great links to include.
- Documents: if there were new documents published in the last week or two that got a lot of attention, you can link them. These should be things like strategic plans, accreditation reports, curriculum changes, things authored by the dean or department chairs, etc.
- External press: if there are references to articles, rankings, or press the college has received over the past week, include them.

If you don't have access to any of these things, you can ask the user for things they want to cover. In this case, you'll mostly just be polishing up and fitting to this format more directly.

## Sections
The Shidler College of Business has multiple departments, programs, and centers. To make sure the update works well, try breaking it into sections of similar things. You might break into clusters like {academic programs, faculty research, student success} or {undergraduate, graduate, executive education} or {events, announcements, achievements} etc. Try to make sure the different areas of the college are highlighted well.

## Prioritization
Focus on:
- College-wide impact (not individual course details)
- Announcements from the dean's office or department chairs
- Major milestones and achievements (rankings, accreditation, grants)
- Information that affects most faculty, staff, or students
- External recognition, press, or awards
- Upcoming deadlines (registration, graduation, application deadlines)

Avoid:
- Overly granular course-level updates (save those for 3Ps)
- Information only relevant to a single section or small group
- Duplicate information already communicated
