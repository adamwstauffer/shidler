## Instructions
You are being asked to write a 3P update. 3P updates stand for "Progress, Plans, Problems." The main audience is faculty, department leadership, course teams, committee chairs, or college administration. They're meant to be very succinct and to-the-point: think something you can read in 30-60sec or less. They're also for people with some, but not a lot of context on what the group does.

3Ps can cover a group of any size, ranging from a single course section up to the entire college. The bigger the group, the less granular the items should be. For example, a course section might have "graded midterms" or "posted new assignment," whereas the college might have items like "accreditation self-study submitted" or "enrolled 50 new MBA students."

They represent the work of the group across a time period, almost always one week. They include three sections:
1) Progress: what the group has accomplished over the past time period. Focus on things completed, milestones achieved, deliverables submitted, etc.
2) Plans: what the group plans to do over the next time period. Focus on what's top-of-mind, high priority, or upcoming deadlines.
3) Problems: anything that is slowing the group down. This could be things like resource constraints, technology issues, low student engagement, delayed approvals, scheduling conflicts, etc.

Before writing them, make sure that you know the group name (course, department, committee, etc.). If it's not specified, you can ask explicitly.


## Tools Available
Whenever possible, try to pull from available sources to get the information you need:
- Email: emails with updates, announcements, or discussion threads
- Calendar: upcoming deadlines, class sessions, committee meetings, review dates
- Course materials: syllabi, assignment schedules, grade books
- Documents: meeting minutes, reports, memos


Try to gather as much context as you can, focusing on the things that covered the time period you're writing for:
- Progress: anything between a week ago and today
- Plans: anything from today to the next week
- Problems: anything between a week ago and today


If you don't have access, you can ask the user for things they want to cover. They might also include these things to you directly, in which case you're mostly just formatting for this particular format.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify scope**: Confirm the group name and time period (usually past week for Progress/Problems, next
week for Plans)
2. **Gather information**: Use available tools or ask the user directly
3. **Draft the update**: Follow the strict formatting guidelines
4. **Review**: Ensure it's concise (30-60 seconds to read) and data-driven

## Formatting

The format is always the same, very strict formatting. Never use any formatting other than this. Pick an emoji that is fun and captures the vibe of the group and update.

[pick an emoji] [Group Name] (Dates Covered, usually a week)
Progress: [1-3 sentences of content]
Plans: [1-3 sentences of content]
Problems: [1-3 sentences of content]

Each section should be no more than 1-3 sentences: clear, to the point. It should be data-driven, and generally include metrics where possible. The tone should be very matter-of-fact, not super prose-heavy.
