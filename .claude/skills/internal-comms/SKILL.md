## When to use this skill
To write internal communications at UH Mānoa / Shidler College of Business, use this skill for:
- 3P updates (Progress, Plans, Problems) for courses, departments, or committees
- College or department newsletters
- FAQ responses for students, faculty, or staff
- Course or program status reports
- Dean's office or department chair updates
- Project and committee updates
- Incident or issue reports

## How to use this skill

To write any internal communication:

1. **Identify the communication type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate guideline file** from the `examples/` directory:
    - `examples/3p-updates.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems updates (courses, committees, departments)
    - `examples/company-newsletter.md` - For college-wide or department newsletters
    - `examples/faq-answers.md` - For answering frequently asked questions from students, faculty, or staff
    - `examples/general-comms.md` - For anything else that doesn't explicitly match one of the above
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering
4. **Apply UH Mānoa branding** — use a professional, institutional tone consistent with university communications

If the communication type doesn't match any existing guideline, ask for clarification or more context about the desired format.
