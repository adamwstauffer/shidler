## âš– Academic Integrity  
This is a **team assignment**. While discussion with other teams is encouraged, the final presentation must reflect your teamâ€™s collective effort. Cases of plagiarism will result in a grade of zero and may have further academic consequences.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success  
- Apply multiple lenses: micro (elasticity, markets, incentives) **and** macro (growth, policy, trade).  
- Be selective â€” 10 slides go fast; focus on insight, not volume.  
- Use AI as a **research and critique partner**, not as a substitute for original analysis.  
- Leverage GitHub for collaboration and version control â€” treat your repo as the teamâ€™s shared workspace.  
- Engage your peers in discussion: prepare 1â€“2 good questions for after your talk.

**Good luck, teams!** Be critical, creative, and professional â€” this is your chance to show how economics and managerial decision-making intersect in a global context.
