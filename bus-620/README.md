Course Description, Objectives & Skills Gained
This MBA-level course provides a comprehensive exploration of microeconomic and macroeconomic theories and their application to real-world business and policy challenges. Emphasis is placed on the intersection of economics, geopolitics, and global stability.
Key learning goals:
Foundational Principles: Elasticity, market structures, efficiency, externalities, and strategic behavior.
Global Environment: Interconnectedness of economies, trade, fiscal/monetary policy, and financial markets.
Geopolitics: How climate change, conflict, and resource control affect economic stability.
Managerial Application: Team-based projects and case studies that apply economic reasoning to real business decisions.
Global Peace & Stability: Explore how interdependence, trade, and cooperation can mitigate or exacerbate international conflict.
By the end of the course, you will be able to integrate economic frameworks with geopolitical awareness to support effective managerial decision-making.

Through the AI + GitHub project, you will also gain practical, workplace-ready skills that can be highlighted on a resume:
AI Literacy & Prompt Engineering: Ability to design effective AI prompts for research, analysis, drafting, and critique, while evaluating limitations and biases.
Reproducible Research Practices: Experience maintaining transparent AI Prompt Logs, ensuring accountability and reproducibility in analysis.
GitHub Collaboration & Version Control: Proficiency with GitHub for project management, version control, and collaborative workflows (branching, pull requests, peer review).
Data Analysis & Visualization: Use of AI and economic/finance models to generate tables, figures, and scenario analyses.
Professional Report Writing: Production of structured policy memos, case briefs, or risk management reports that integrate quantitative analysis with narrative clarity.
Resume/LinkedIn Keywords: AI-assisted analysis · Prompt engineering · GitHub workflow · Reproducible research

Individual Research Paper (45%): Students will select a global economic challenge, apply course frameworks, and produce a research paper. Peer evaluation also accounts for 50% of the grade.

AI + GitHub Course Project (Policy Shock Analysis)
In addition to case studies and papers, students will complete a structured AI + GitHub project analyzing the effects of a policy shock (e.g., rent control, subsidies, tariffs, or monetary/fiscal interventions).
Scope: Apply supply and demand, elasticity, and AS–AD models to evaluate policy outcomes for consumers, producers, and society.
AI Integration: Students may use AI for drafting, critique, sensitivity analysis, and visualization. All uses must be recorded in a Prompt Log.
GitHub Integration: Students will submit deliverables to GitHub (memo, appendix, figures, prompt log), practicing version control and collaborative workflows.
Workflow:
README (Assignment Brief) – outlines goals and rubric
Prompts – curated + student-developed AI queries (logged)
Spec – project plan (models, data, acceptance criteria)
Analysis & Deliverables – memo, appendix, figures
Prompt Log & Reflection – document AI use and limitations
