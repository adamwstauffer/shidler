## ‚öñ Academic Integrity  
This is an **individual assignment**. Discussion with peers is allowed, but your final paper must reflect your own analysis. Plagiarism or misuse of AI will result in a zero and may trigger further disciplinary action.

## üí° Tips for Success  
- Apply theories from both **micro** (elasticity, market structures, incentives) and **macro** (fiscal/monetary policy, trade, growth, stability).  
- Be concise and analytical ‚Äî two strong pages are better than four unfocused ones.  
- Use AI as a **support tool**, not a shortcut. Record all use transparently.  
- Visuals matter ‚Äî a well-designed figure often makes your argument clearer than a paragraph.  
- Think like a **manager and policymaker**: what would you recommend, and why?
