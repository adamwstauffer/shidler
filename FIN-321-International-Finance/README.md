### Attendance & Participation

Attendance will be recorded and contributes to your grade. Active participation is expected.

### Homework

Assigned weekly via MH Connect due Fridays by midnight.

### AI + GitHub Course Project

This course includes a multi-phase project on FX risk management:

**Scope:** Map a multinational firm's currency exposures, compute forward rates (via interest parity), and compare hedging strategies (forwards, options, collars).

**AI Integration:** Students may use AI for scenario building, payoff tables, drafting memos, and critique. All use must be logged in the Prompt Log.

**GitHub Integration:** Students will maintain a GitHub repo with templates, deliverables, and version control. Workflows will mirror professional consulting and finance practices.

Project Workflow:
* README (Assignment Brief) – defines goals and rubric
* Prompts – curated list of AI uses + student adaptations
* Spec – project plan (models, data, criteria)
* Analysis & Deliverables – calculations, figures, memos
* Prompt Log & Reflection – AI use documentation

### Examinations

Midterm & Final Exam on MH Connect

Make-up exams will only be considered for legitimate, documented circumstances (serious illness, family emergency). Instructor approval must be obtained in advance. Make-up exams may be more rigorous than the original.
