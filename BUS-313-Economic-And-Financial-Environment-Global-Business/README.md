## Course Outline

The course begins with foundational supply and demand analysis in open economies and comparative advantage, then progresses through more complex trade models and their real-world applications. The latter half of the course covers policy tools (tariffs, quotas), trade agreements, environmental considerations, and international factor movements (multinationals, migration). Emphasis throughout is placed on understanding winners and losers from trade and policy, with applications to contemporary geopolitical challenges.

### AI + GitHub Course Project (Trade & Tariff Case Brief)

This project applies course concepts to a real-world trade dispute or policy (tariffs, quotas, or trade agreements). Students will:

* Apply Ricardian, Heckscher-Ohlin, and Specific-Factors models
* Identify winners/losers across consumers, producers, and governments
* Evaluate distributional and policy implications
* Use AI for research, modeling, critique, and visualization
* Use GitHub for reproducibility (templates, deliverables, prompt logs)

Workflow:
* README (Assignment Brief) – outlines problem and rubric
* Prompts – AI queries (students adapt/expand but must log)
* Spec – project plan (models, data, acceptance criteria)
* Analysis & Deliverables – case brief, tables, figures
* Prompt Log & Reflection – documentation of AI use

### Examinations

Midterm & Final Exam on MH Connect.

Make-up exams are only considered for legitimate, documented circumstances (serious illness, family emergency). Approval must be obtained in advance.
