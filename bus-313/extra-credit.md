     * Why does this path appeal to you?
     * What skills, experiences, or credentials do you need?
   * **Challenges you are facing:**

5. **AI & LLM Usage Section (required)**
   At the end of the memo, include a clearly labeled section:

   ## AI & LLM Usage

   - Did you use an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini) to help with this memo? Yes / No
   - If **Yes**, briefly explain:
     - Which tool(s) you used
     - What you used them for (e.g., brainstorming, outline, grammar check)
     - How you reviewed and edited the output
   - Example attribution:
     - “I used ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025) to brainstorm outline ideas and then rewrote all sections in my own words.”
   ```

   If you **did not** use any AI tools, state that clearly (e.g., “No AI tools were used in preparing this memo.”).
