üîπ What is a ‚Äúspec‚Äù?

In the OpenAI video Introducing Specs
, a spec (short for specification) is a structured document that clearly defines:

the goal of a task,

the steps required,

the expected inputs/outputs, and

the evaluation criteria.

It acts as a contract between humans and AI systems, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and clarity in how work is done.

üîπ Specs vs. Prompts

Prompts: Instructions given to an AI in natural language. They are flexible, conversational, and immediate. Example: ‚ÄúExplain Interest Rate Parity with an example.‚Äù

Specs: Formalized blueprints that outline how to approach a problem systematically. They provide context, requirements, and evaluation rules.

How they complement each other:

A spec defines the scope and structure of a task.

A prompt executes a part of that task inside the spec.

In practice:

The spec ensures that multiple people (or agents) would approach the problem the same way.

The prompts are the tactical instructions used at each stage.

üîπ Using Specs + Prompts in Economics

In teaching: Specs define structured student projects (e.g., analyzing tariffs, calculating FX hedges). Prompts help students generate analysis, visuals, or summaries.

In research: Specs define methodology (e.g., data sources, models, reproducibility requirements). Prompts handle execution (e.g., regression code, lit review summaries).

In policy/consulting: Specs provide consistent evaluation frameworks (e.g., for assessing monetary policy). Prompts generate scenario narratives and what-if analyses.

How specs & prompts complement each other (quick explainer to include in class)
- Specs = blueprint/contract (objective, scope, inputs, steps, outputs, evaluation).
- Prompts = tactical instructions you run at each step.
- Together they enforce clarity, consistency, and reproducibility ‚Äî exactly what employers expect.
