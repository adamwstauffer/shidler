# Templates & Examples

Reusable templates and example documents for course materials, assignments, and professional portfolio materials.

## What is a "spec"?

In the OpenAI video [Introducing Specs](https://openai.com/index/introducing-specs/), a spec (short for specification) is a structured document that clearly defines:

- the goal of a task
- the steps required
- the expected inputs/outputs
- the evaluation criteria

It acts as a contract between humans and AI systems, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and clarity in how work is done.

### Specs vs. Prompts

**Prompts:** Instructions given to an AI in natural language. They are flexible, conversational, and immediate. Example: "Explain Interest Rate Parity with an example."

**Specs:** Formalized blueprints that outline how to approach a problem systematically. They provide context, requirements, and evaluation rules.

**How they complement each other:**

- A spec defines the scope and structure of a task.
- A prompt executes a part of that task inside the spec.

In practice:

- The spec ensures that multiple people (or agents) would approach the problem the same way.
- The prompts are the tactical instructions used at each stage.

### Using Specs + Prompts in Economics

**In teaching:** Specs define structured student projects (e.g., analyzing tariffs, calculating FX hedges). Prompts help students generate analysis, visuals, or summaries.

**In research:** Specs define methodology (e.g., data sources, models, reproducibility requirements). Prompts handle execution (e.g., regression code, lit review summaries).

**In policy/consulting:** Specs provide consistent evaluation frameworks (e.g., for assessing monetary policy). Prompts generate scenario narratives and what-if analyses.

**Together they enforce clarity, consistency, and reproducibility — exactly what employers expect.**

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Copy the appropriate template** to your course or project directory
2. **Customize for your needs** – Add course-specific context, requirements, and examples
3. **Link from course materials** – Reference templates in README.md files and assignment briefs
4. **Maintain consistency** – Use the same template structure across all projects and courses
