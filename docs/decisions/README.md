# Decisions & Strategic Memos

This directory contains strategic and administrative decision memos that are being reviewed, discussed, and refined for organizational and instructional direction.

## Purpose

Decision memos serve as:
- **Documentation of reasoning** – Capture the "why" behind organizational and pedagogical choices
- **Decision inputs** – Feed into the development of plans, specifications, and course materials
- **Institutional memory** – Preserve context for future decision-making
- **Discussion artifacts** – Enable collaborative refinement of strategies and approaches

## How Decisions Flow

```
Decision Memo → Discussion → Refinement → Plans & Specifications → Implementation
```

**Example flow:**
1. A decision memo proposes a new course structure or assessment approach
2. Stakeholders review and discuss implications
3. Memo is refined based on feedback
4. Decision is documented and formalized
5. Plans (course syllabi, project rubrics) are developed based on the decision
6. Specifications (assignment briefs, Excel models) are created for implementation
7. Instructors and students execute the plan
