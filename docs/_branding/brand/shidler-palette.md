# Shidler Finance — Color Palette

## Design Philosophy

The palette is inspired by **University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's public
brand colors** (green + white) and extended with investment-banking
conservative tones: charcoal backgrounds, muted gold accents, and slate
neutrals. Colors are intentionally subdued — no primaries, no neons.

## Primary Brand Colors

| Role | Name | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **UH Green** | Mānoa Green | `#024731` | Header bands, badges, accent strips — both variants (per manoa.hawaii.edu/brand) |
| **Muted Gold** (dark) | Antique Gold | `#B39B5E` | Accent text, divider lines on dark backgrounds |
| **Muted Gold** (light) | Deep Gold | `#8A6F3A` | Accent text, divider lines on light backgrounds |

> The gold is inspired by UH Mānoa's secondary palette and deliberately
> desaturated to read as "serious" rather than celebratory.

## Chart Color Sequence

When creating charts, use accent colors in this order so series are
visually distinct and consistent across all decks:

1. `#024731` — UH Green (primary series)
2. `#B39B5E` — Antique Gold (secondary series)
3. `#4A6274` — Slate Blue (tertiary series)
4. `#3D7A6E` — Muted Teal (quaternary series)
5. `#7A3B3F` — Deep Burgundy (fifth series)
6. `#7A7568` — Warm Gray (sixth / reference series)

> For single-series charts (most common in finance courses), always use
> `#024731`. For two-series comparisons, use Green + Gold.

## Do / Don't

**Do**
- Use UH Green (`#024731`) for the header band on every slide
- Use gold sparingly — emphasis text, dividers, and chart accents only
- Keep body text in the designated grays; do not introduce new text colors

**Don't**
- Don't use pure black (`#000000`) or pure white (`#FFFFFF`) as primary
  text colors — they read as harsh in presentation environments
- Don't add new colors outside this palette without updating this file
- Don't use the bright accent colors (`accent5`, `accent6`) for body text
