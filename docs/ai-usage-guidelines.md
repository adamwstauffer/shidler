# AI Use Guidelines
Use AI to brainstorm, check math, draft, and critique. You must:
1) Log meaningful prompts/outputs in `deliverables/prompt-log.md`
2) Verify calculations & sources
3) Mark AI-assisted sections in memos when material
Misuse (undocumented AI or plagiarism) violates academic integrity.
